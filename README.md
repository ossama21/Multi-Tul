# MULTI-TUL:
This code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the `tkinter` library, offering various functionalities related to system information, control settings, weather, clock, calendar, and launching certain applications. Let's break down the code into different sections to understand its functionality:

1. **Importing Modules:**
   The code starts by importing various necessary modules, including `tkinter` for GUI, modules for controlling brightness, audio, weather information, time-related functions, calendar, and more.

2. **Creating the GUI:**
   The main GUI window is created using the `Tk()` class. The window title, size, and icon are set. The `Body` frame is created within the window, which holds most of the application's content.

3. **Left-hand Side (LHS) Content:**
   The LHS of the GUI contains system information such as computer name, operating system version, RAM installed, processor details, and GPU details. The system information is fetched using the `wmi` module.

4. **Right-hand Side (RHS) Content:**
   The RHS of the GUI contains sections for battery status, speaker volume control, and screen brightness control. It utilizes various libraries such as `psutil` for battery information and `pycaw` for audio control. The brightness control utilizes the `screen_brightness_control` library.

5. **Battery Section:**
   This section displays battery percentage, whether the device is plugged in, and the estimated time remaining. It uses the `psutil` library to retrieve battery information.

6. **Speaker Section:**
   This section provides a slider to adjust the speaker volume. It utilizes the `pycaw` library to interact with the audio settings and control the volume.

7. **Brightness Section:**
   This section provides a slider to adjust the screen brightness. It uses the `screen_brightness_control` library to control the screen brightness.

8. **Weather Function:**
   This function opens a new window that allows users to input a city name and retrieves weather information (temperature, wind, humidity, etc.) using the OpenWeatherMap API. The `geopy` and `timezonefinder` libraries are used to obtain timezone information.

9. **Clock Function:**
   This function opens a new window that displays the current time using the `strftime` function. The time is updated every second.

10. **Calendar Function:**
    This function opens a new window with a calendar widget using the `tkcalendar` library.

11. **Dark Mode Function:**
    Placeholder function for enabling a dark mode theme.

12. **Game Function:**
    Placeholder function for launching a game.

13. **Screenshot Function:**
    This function minimizes the main window and takes a screenshot of the entire screen using the `pyautogui` library. Users are prompted to choose a save location.

14. **File Function:**
    This function opens a file explorer window to select a file.

15. **Google and YouTube Functions:**
    These functions open web browser windows to the Google and YouTube websites using the `webbrowser` module.

16. **Close Window Function:**
    This function closes the main GUI window.

17. **Creating App Buttons:**
    The GUI includes buttons for launching the weather, clock, calendar, dark mode, screenshot, file explorer, Google, YouTube, and closing the application.

18. **Main Event Loop:**
    The script enters the main event loop using `root.mainloop()`, which continuously updates and handles user interactions with the GUI elements.

Overall, this code creates a GUI application that provides various functionalities related to system information, control settings, weather, time, and launching specific applications. It seems like a tool that combines several features for users to interact with their system and access relevant information in one place.
